### Finally Backup
So I have decided its time for a new site and blog. I have been playing with
this idea for a while. I have been really busy at work and in my personal life.
I originally started a blog back in 2004 and now here we are in 2015. With more
blog options then ever before. 

#### Engine Choice
So when I picked my blog engine I knew I never wanted to have a database
server. I wanted the ability to throw this up on any thing that can serve html
statically. Theres a TON of static site generators all over the place. There
are written in various languages. I choose hugo written in GOLANG because one
I wanted to learn GOLANG and two its extremely well used based off my research
on github.
